<p>You can contact a supervisory authority at any time with a complaint, such as the competent supervisory authority of the federal state of your residence or the authority responsible for us as the responsible entity.</p>
<p>A list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) with addresses can be found at: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Service/Anschriften/Laender/Laender-node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Service/Anschriften/Laender/Laender-node.html</a>.</p>
<p></p><p>In the case of storing data in log files, this is the case after a maximum of 14 days. Further storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of users are anonymized so that an assignment to the calling client is no longer possible.</p>

<h3>Legal basis:</h3>

<h2>Information about your right to object under Art. 21 GDPR</h2>
<h3>Case-by-case right to object</h3>
<p>You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (processing based on a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Article 4(4) GDPR.</p>
