            >Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban
            project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what
            Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</span

          <h2>What is Join?</h2>
          <span
            >Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
            by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development
            bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning
            "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages
            the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and
            projects in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note
            that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended
            for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best
            possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
            availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality
            regarding Join.</span

          <h2>How to use it</h2>
          <span>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</span>

          <div id="explanation">
            <div class="section">
              <p class="counter">1.</p>
              <span>
                <p class="section_headline" >Exploring the Board</p>
                When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board
                represents your project and contains four default lists: "To
                Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span
              >
            </div>
            <div class="section">
              <p class="counter">2.</p>
              <span>
                <p class="section_headline" >Creating Contacts</p>
                In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
                Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill
                in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
                assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                board.</span
              >
            </div>
            <div class="section">
              <p class="counter">3.</p>
              <span>
                <p class="section_headline" >Adding Cards</p>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.</span
              >
            </div>
            <div class="section">
              <p class="counter">4.</p>
              <span>
                <p class="section_headline" >Moving Cards</p>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.</span
              >
            </div>
            <div class="section">
              <p class="counter">5.</p>

              <span>
                <p class="section_headline" >Deleting Cards</p>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                this action is irreversible. Remember that using Join
                effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team
                to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
